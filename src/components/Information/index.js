        How does the coronavirus spread?
        <h3 className="article">
          As of now, researchers know that the coronavirus is spread through
          droplets and virus particles released into the air when an infected
          person breathes, talks, laughs, sings, coughs or sneezes. Larger
          droplets may fall to the ground in a few seconds, but tiny infectious
          particles can linger in the air and accumulate in indoor places,
          especially where many people are gathered and there is poor
          ventilation. This is why mask-wearing, hand hygiene and physical
          distancing are essential to preventing COVID-19.

        How did the coronavirus start?
        <br />
        <h3 className="article">
          The first case of COVID-19 was reported Dec. 1, 2019, and the cause
          was a then-new coronavirus later named SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 may have
          originated in an animal and changed (mutated) so it could cause
          illness in humans. In the past, several infectious disease outbreaks
          have been traced to viruses originating in birds, pigs, bats and other
          animals that mutated to become dangerous to humans. Research
          continues, and more study may reveal how and why the coronavirus
          evolved to cause pandemic disease.

        What is the incubation period for COVID-19?
        <br />
        <h3 className="article">
          Symptoms show up in people within two to 14 days of exposure to the
          virus. A person infected with the coronavirus is contagious to others
          for up to two days before symptoms appear, and they remain contagious
          to others for 10 to 20 days, depending upon their immune system and
          the severity of their illness.

        How is COVID-19 treated?
        <br />
        <h3 className="article">
          Treatment for COVID-19 addresses the signs and symptoms of the
          infection and supports people with more severe disease. For mild cases
          of coronavirus disease, your doctor may recommend measures such as
          fever reducers or over-the-counter medications. More severe cases may
          require hospital care, where a patient may receive a combination of
          treatments that could include steroids, oxygen, mechanical breathing
          support and other COVID-19 treatments in development. Infusions of
          monoclonal antibodies given to certain patients early in the infection
          may reduce the symptoms, severity and duration of the illness.

        How do you protect yourself from this coronavirus?
        <br />
        <h3 className="article">
          AVaccines are now authorized to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2, the
          coronavirus that causes COVID-19. But until more is understood about
          how the vaccines affect a person’s ability to transmit the virus,
          precautions such as mask-wearing, physical distancing and hand hygiene
          should continue regardless of a person’s vaccination status to help
          prevent the spread of COVID-19. Learn more about the COVID-19 vaccine
          and ways to protect yourself.

          Yes, severe COVID-19 can be fatal. For updates of coronavirus

        Why is it called coronavirus?
        <br />
        <h3 className="article">
          Coronaviruses are named for their appearance: “corona” means “crown.”
          The virus’s outer layers are covered with spike proteins that surround
          them like a crown.

        Is this coronavirus different from SARS?
        <br />
        <h3 className="article">
          SARS stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome. In 2003, an
          outbreak of SARS affected people in several countries before ending in
          2004. The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is similar to the one that
          caused the 2003 SARS outbreak. Since the 2019 coronavirus is related
          to the original coronavirus that caused SARS and can also cause severe
          acute respiratory syndrome, there is “SARS” in its name: SARS-CoV-2.
          Much is still unknown about these viruses, but SARS-CoV-2 spreads
          faster and farther than the 2003 SARS-CoV-1 virus. This is likely
          because of how easily it is transmitted person to person, even from
          asymptomatic carriers of the virus.
